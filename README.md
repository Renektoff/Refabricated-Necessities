# Refabricated-Necessities

A mod that includes ports of a bunch of Forge related items that don't currently have a home in Fabric (with tweaks in certain cases and a few additional functionalities).

Currently has:

- Morphing Tool from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/morph-o-tool 
  - Has pretty much 1:1 functionality to the old Morphing Tool including the settings and the way they're configured.
- Feral Flare Lantern from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/torchmaster 
  - Also includes a custom "Feral Flare Torch" item that you can bind to a lantern. It allows you to place down an invisible torch yourself that is bound to that lantern (meaning it'll be cleaned up automatically when the bound lantern is destroyed). Main use case it placing an invisible light in that corner of your room that just refuses to be lit up by the random aspect of the Feral Flare Lantern.
I felt annoyed with the Feral Flare Lantern at certain times because it was a bit too random at times.
  - I tweaked the placement algorithm a bit so now it should be placing down invisible lights on surfaces more reliably once it detects a surface.

This mod is required on both the server and the client.

Let me know if there's an item that you feel like is currently missing from Fabric, I'd be down to porting it now that I've dipped my toes into Minecraft mods =)
